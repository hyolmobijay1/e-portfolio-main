    <h2><span> Week 2</span></h2>
        <p>
          This week, I was learning more about HTML forms and navigation,
          placing links and menus were great for usability. I used CSS
          selectors, IDs and classes in Module 2 to style specific areas of the
          layout. I also started using external stylesheets to help manage my
          code.
