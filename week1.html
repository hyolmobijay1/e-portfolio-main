          I started to investigate the structure of HTML, designing headings,
          paragraphs and lists to organize the content. It was great to get to
          place the skeleton of a web page together. I moved on to Module 2
          where I learned colour, fonts and margins in CSS, it was exciting to
          style the structure and I learned about the impact of visual
          components on user experience.
