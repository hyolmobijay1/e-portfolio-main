    <h2><span> Week 10</span></h2>
        <p>
          In my final week, I focused on accessibility by adding alt text and
          appropriate labels for widgets and forms. I added some finishing
          touches like transitions and animations. In the second module, I had
          an overview of the whole project, documented it, and prepared to
          present it. I am proud of what I built.
