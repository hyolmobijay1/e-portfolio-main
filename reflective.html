    <h1>Reflective Writing</h1>
    <div class="angry-grid">
      <div id="item">
        <h2><span> Week 1</span></h2>
        <p>
          I started to investigate the structure of HTML, designing headings,
          paragraphs and lists to organize the content. It was great to get to
          place the skeleton of a web page together. I moved on to Module 2
          where I learned colour, fonts and margins in CSS, it was exciting to
          style the structure and I learned about the impact of visual
          components on user experience.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="item">
        <h2><span> Week 2</span></h2>
        <p>
          This week, I was learning more about HTML forms and navigation,
          placing links and menus were great for usability. I used CSS
          selectors, IDs and classes in Module 2 to style specific areas of the
          layout. I also started using external stylesheets to help manage my
          code.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="item">
        <h2><span> Week 3</span></h2>
        <p>
          I worked on creating multiple HTML pages (index, contact, CV) and
          linking them with a consistent navigation. This was beneficial for
          understanding a multi-page site structure. In Module 2 I practiced
          using media queries for responsive design and learned how websites
          rescale on different screens. Mobile-first design principles were a
          major takeaway.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="item">
        <h2>Week 4</h2>
        <p>
          I improved my semantic HTML by using appropriate tags for , , and .
          This was beneficial because my pages were structured and accessible. I
          have a good understanding of how to use images while being able to
          control the size and placement of them in CSS. Module 2 concentrated
          on layout methods like Flexbox which I much preferred as it allowed me
          to position component easier.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="item">
        <h2><span> Week 5</span></h2>
        <p>
          I used the tags to create a contact form this week. Seeing how forms
          work was satisfying. I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript in the
          second module. I felt more in control of the website after practicing
          writing basic scripts to change content.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="item">
        <h2><span> Week 6</span></h2>
        <p>
          I improved my CV page by adding tables and lists to present
          information in a clearer way. I've also started using JavaScript,
          where I played with event listeners so I could create buttons and have
          them run functions. It was thrilling to now have pages respond to some
          kind of user action once the button was clicked. This also got me to
          think about how to bring all three elements (HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript) together.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="item">
        <h2><span> Week 7</span></h2>
        <p>
          I've added an image and a video to the media section, and learnt about
          size, controls, and formats. This really helped create a more dynamic
          view of my experience. Module 2 also introduced some basic DOM
          manipulation. I was able to change content with JavaScript.
          Manipulating interactive elements and seeing how to alter them in
          real-time was cool.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="item">
        <h2><span> Week 8</span></h2>
        <p>
          I put the finishing touches on the look and feel of my site. I was
          able to ensure my fonts, colours, and spacing were consistent across
          all folders and pages. In Module 2, I also experimented with audio
          elements and was able to use autoplay and looping controls. It was an
          interesting experience to think about how engaging I could make my
          site with multimedia, while still considering it from an informative
          and functional perspective.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="item">
        <h2><span> Week 9</span></h2>
        <p>
          I also tested my site and layout bugs across devices and browsers to
          fix with responsive CSS, which also made me aware of the real-life
          needs for testing. I learned in module 2 about optimization;
          compressing images, and cleaning up code to enhance performance and
          speed.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="item">
        <h2><span> Week 10</span></h2>
        <p>
          In my final week, I focused on accessibility by adding alt text and
          appropriate labels for widgets and forms. I added some finishing
          touches like transitions and animations. In the second module, I had
          an overview of the whole project, documented it, and prepared to
          present it. I am proud of what I built.
