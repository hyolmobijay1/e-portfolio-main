     <h2><span> Week 8</span></h2>
        <p>
          I put the finishing touches on the look and feel of my site. I was
          able to ensure my fonts, colours, and spacing were consistent across
          all folders and pages. In Module 2, I also experimented with audio
          elements and was able to use autoplay and looping controls. It was an
          interesting experience to think about how engaging I could make my
          site with multimedia, while still considering it from an informative
          and functional perspective.
